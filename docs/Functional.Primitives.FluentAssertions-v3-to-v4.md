# Upgrading from v3.x to x4.x

Due to NuGet package version dependencies, both `FluentAssertions` and `Functional.Primitives.FluentAssertions` must be updated at the same time.  `Functional.Primitives.FluentAssertions` v3.x depends on `FluentAssertions` v5.x, so consult the [v6.x upgrade guide for `FluentAssertions`](https://fluentassertions.com/upgradingtov6) after updating.
