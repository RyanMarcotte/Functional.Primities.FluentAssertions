# Contributing

The libraries in `Functional.Utilities` are intended to be application-agnostic. As such, library enhancements and modifications must be discussed first. Please [log an issue](https://github.com/RyanMarcotte/Functional.FluentAssertions/issues) prior to writing any code.  Unless you have already been added as a repository contributor, the preferred method of submitting a pull request is to fork this repository, make code changes, and then submit a pull request back to this repository.

Feature branches are created off of `master` and merged in after code review.

All code submitted for code review must possess sufficient unit test coverage to demonstrate the correctness of the new code and - if applicable - demonstrate that the new code does not break existing functionality.  The meaning of "sufficient" is dependent on the code being submitted for review.  When in doubt, submit a pull request.

NuGet package releases are semantically versioned and (currently) manually deployed.
